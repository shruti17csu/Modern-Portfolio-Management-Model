<p><b>Fama And French Three Factor Model</b><br>
The Fama and French Three Factor Model is an asset pricing model that expands on the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) by adding size and value factors to the market risk factor in CAPM. This model considers the fact that value and small-cap stocks outperform markets on a regular basis. By including these two additional factors, the model adjusts for the outperformance tendency, which is thought to make it a better tool for evaluating manager performance. The three factors are Market Risks, Company Size and Value Factors.

<b>BREAKING DOWN Fama And French Three Factor Model</b><br>
Eugene Fama and Kenneth French, both professors at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, attempted to better measure market returns and, through research, found that value stocks outperform growth stocks. Similarly, small-cap stocks tend to outperform large-cap stocks. As an evaluation tool, the performance of portfolios with a large number of small-cap or value stocks would be lower than the CAPM result, as the Three Factor Model adjusts downward for small-cap and value outperformance.

<b>What Does It Mean for Investors?</b><br>
Fama and French were quick to point out that, while value beats growth and small beats large, over the long term, investors must be able to ride out the extra short-term volatility and periodic underperformance that could occur in a given short-term time frame. Investors with a long-term time horizon of 15 years or more will be rewarded for any pain they might suffer in the short term. Fama-French conducted studies to test their model, using thousands of random stock portfolios and found that when size and value factors are combined with the beta factor, they could then explain as much as 95% of the return in a diversified stock portfolio.

Given the ability to explain 95% of a portfolioâ€™s return versus the market as a whole, investors can construct a portfolio in which they receive an average expected return according to the relative risks they assume in their portfolios. The main factors driving expected returns are sensitivity to the market; sensitivity to size, as in small-cap stocks; and sensitivity to value stocks, as measured by the book-to-market ratio. Any additional average expected return may be attributed to unpriced or unsystematic risk.</p>

<i>Modern Portfolio Management Using Capital Asset Pricing And Fama-French Three Factor Model</i>
<ul>
  <li>Identify Beta and Volatility values for Large, Mid and 
Small Cap Stocks</li>
<li>Back Testing of the Index with stocks and performance 
over 8 years period</li>
<li>Help arrives at a set of stocks that could constitute 
MyPortfolio (max of 25 stocks)</li>
<li>Determine the weights to be provided to each stock in the 
portfolio</li>
<li> Determine the Efficiency Frontier for 2 portfolios based 
on back-testing for 2 years</li>
<li>Provide Options to the Investor depending on the Risk 
Profile, with a guidance around Expected Returns, 
Volatility and Sharpe Ratio of the underlying two 
portfolios with stock weights</li>
</ul>
<b>Conclusion</b><br>
Relatively Higher Risk with Higher Returns which has a 
Portfolio Return of 39% with Volatility of 19% and 
Portfolio Sharpe Ratio of 2.01
